# KR1M - Part 7

## Background

In this session, we will be adding some animation to our app. We will be animating our list item's `Kedai` image to into the new position inside `KedaiDetailActivity`

> Meaningful transitions

>Motion design can effectively guide the userâ€™s attention in ways that both inform and delight. Use motion to smoothly transport users between navigational contexts, explain changes in the arrangement of elements on a screen, and reinforce element hierarchy.

## Creating transitions

You may refer to the Sub-Section [Start an activity using transitions](https://developer.android.com/training/material/animations.html#Transitions)

1. In your `list_item_kedai.xml` give an `@+id` to your `ImageView`
2. In your `activity_kedai_detail.xml`'s `ImageView` where it displays the hero image of a Kedai Rakyat, add a new attribute `android:transitionName="hero"`
3. Modify your start detail activity `Intent` to pass a `Bundle` related to our information
  - Note: `Activity` transition only works for Lollipop onwards. This API appears in API21+
  - For compatibility purposes, we will make use of `ActivityCompat` and `ActivityOptionsCompat` from the v4 Android Support Library
    - If you see any "\*Compat" such as `NotificationCompat` it means that for non-supported Android versions, there will be no-operation
4. Before `startActivity`, create our Animation bundle using `ActivityOptionsCompat#makeSceneTransitionAnimation(Activity activity, View sharedElement, String sharedElementName)`.
  - Our sharedElement is our ImageView, find and pass in that
  - Our sharedElementName is the `android:transitionName="hero"` that was declared in the Detail Activity
  - This would make the system to understand that:
    1. Our starting element is list item's `ImageView`
    2. It is suppose to animate into an end result that has the matching sharedElementName  
5. Use `ActivityCompat#startActivity(Activity activity, Intent intent, Bundle options)` to pass in our create Animation bundle and start our `KedaiDetailActivity`

## Display simple Animations for older devices

Since Activity Transitions are only available in API 21+, we could also enhance our screen animation that are available on older Android versions. We will be doing a Scale Up Animation when starting our Detail Activity

1. To figure out what Android version our app is running on user device, we can use `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT` which would return the API level e.g. 23 for Android Marshmallow
  - In general
  ```java
  if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP) {
        // we are not on Lollipop, use older API
  } else {
        // we are running at least Lollipop, can use new Lollipop API
  }
  ```
2. For Android versions runnning lesser than Lollipop, use the `ActivityOptionsCompat#makeScaleUpAnimation(View source, int startX, int startY, int startWidth, int startHeight)` to create your Animation Bundle
3. Continue using `ActivityCompat#startActivity(Activity activity, Intent intent, Bundle options)` and pass our Scale Up Animation bundle.
